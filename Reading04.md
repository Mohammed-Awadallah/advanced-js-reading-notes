## Questions

 **Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development ?**
 -   TDD creates a detailed specification.
 -  You spend less time in the debugger.
 -   You are able to identify the errors and problems quickly.

 **In what case would you need to use  `beforeEach()`  or  `afterEach()`  in a test suite?**
 -   We need the afterEach() method to rest the database after run the test, while the beforeEach() we called before the test running.
 
 **What is one downside of Test Driven Development ?**
 -   Not running tests frequently enough; Writing tests that are too large; Writing too many tests at once; Writing insignificant tests.
 
 **What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes ?**
 -   The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.
 
 ## Vocabulary Documentation 
 **functional programming**: Generally, functional programming means using functions to the best effect for creating clean and maintainable software. More specifically, functional programming is a set of approaches to coding, usually described as a programming _paradigm_.
 **object-oriented programming (OOP)**:is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
 **class**: is a blueprint for creating **objects** (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
 **Test Driven Development (TDD)**:test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.
 **Jest**:Javascript testing framework
 **Continuous Integration (CI)**:It’s a set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes as a mechanism to integrate and validate changes.
 **REST**:stand for Representational State Transfer and it is an architectural pattern which work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON can make use of SOAP.
 **Data Model**:is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
 
 ## Preview
 1.  SQL databases are primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases while NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases.
2.  SQL is used by RDBMS to analyse and utilise data for insights, as well as OLAP (online analytical processing) systems, while NoSQL databases consist of various technologies.
3.  SQL databases are table based databases, while NoSQL databases can be document based, key-value pairs or graph databases.
4.  SQL DBs (Databases) are vertically scalable, while NoSQL DBs are horizontally so.
5.  SQL is an ideal choice for the complex query intensive environment, while NoSQL is not.
6.  SQL is not suitable for hierarchical data storage while NoSQL supports key-value pair method, hence is an ideal choice.
7.  SQL should be used when data validity and dynamic queries have to be supported, while NoSQL is used when fast data, rather than accurate data, and scalability are required.
8.  The advantages of SQL are cross-platform support, better secure and free usage, while the advantages of NoSQL are that it’s easy to use, has higher performance and has great flexibility.
9.  Examples of SQL are Oracle, Postgres and MS-SQL, while examples of NoSQL are MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, Cassandra and Hbase.
