In here i'll be posting my observations in the upcoming lectures.


## Event Loop

JavaScript has a runtime model based on an **event loop**, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.

## JS callback functions

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

## JS Promises

The **`Promise`** object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
A **`Promise`** is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created.

## JS Async/Await

The `async` and `await` keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

## Test-Driven Development

is a Software development process relying on software requirements being converted to Test case before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
