## Ethics in Technology
>Ethics in technology, simply put, refers to moral principles that govern how technologies should be used. These principles include accountability, digital rights, privacy, freedom, data protection, online behaviour, and more. As new technologies become available, ethical issues are raised in an attempt to ensure that these have a positive impact on the human race and the environment.

### Why talk about it?

Last year, the Institute for the Future (IFTF) estimated that 85% of jobs that will exist in 2030 haven’t yet been invented. With the implementation of new technology comes an ethical duty, and it’s important that the generation who’ll be taking up these future jobs have a sound understanding of their ethical responsibilities.

Take hacking, for instance. Hacking has both negative and positive meanings, in that accessing a computer system without authorisation might be illegal, but it’s also a term used for remixing or testing new ways of using computers or programs. It’s important that young people have a good understanding of how and when it’s acceptable to hack, and when and where the line is crossed.
